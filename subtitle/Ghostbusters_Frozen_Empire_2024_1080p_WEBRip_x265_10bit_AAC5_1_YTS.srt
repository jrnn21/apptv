3
00:01:35,617 --> 00:01:38,141
-Hah! Hah!

4
00:01:38,315 --> 00:01:40,883
- Hah! Hah!

5
00:01:41,057 --> 00:01:42,841
Hah!

6
00:01:43,015 --> 00:01:44,930
- Hah! Hah!

7
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:18,747
It's freezing.

8
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,232
- Nah, that doesn't sound good.

9
00:04:36,406 --> 00:04:38,887
- Bike, bike, bike, bike! Whoa!

10
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,371
So, a photon is checking
into a hotel.

11
00:04:44,545 --> 00:04:45,763
Can we not do jokes
right now, please?

12
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:46,851
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

13
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:51,552
-Whoa!

14
00:04:51,726 --> 00:04:53,336
-Red light! Red light!

15
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,816
The bellhop asks,

16
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,383
"Do you need help
with your luggage?"

17
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:57,775
To which the photon responds,
"No, thanks.

18
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:59,081
I'm traveling light."

19
00:04:59,255 --> 00:05:01,083
- Wow.

20
00:05:01,257 --> 00:05:03,781
Hey, can we get some air going
back here? It's like a furnace.

21
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:06,697
-No air.

22
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:08,917
Also no power.

23
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:10,484
Trev, we need power!

24
00:05:10,658 --> 00:05:12,137
Can you not talk to me
like that, please?

25
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,270
- I'm 18 now. I'm an adult.
-Oh, come on.

26
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:16,707
- We're on a job, buddy.
- I'm not getting paid.

27
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:18,666
- Are you getting paid? Cool.
- No.

28
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,015
Does anyone else
feel exploited?

29
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,364
We're all being paid--

30
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:22,322
- with memories.

31
00:05:22,496 --> 00:05:23,627
- Ow!

32
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:25,455
- Oh, you're fine.
-Oh.

33
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:27,718
Actually, guys, I'm fine.
Mom says I'm fine. Welcome.

34
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:33,507
Oh!

35
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:35,813
Wonderful news from the back
seat. The windows are stuck.

36
00:05:35,987 --> 00:05:37,380
I can open a door.

37
00:05:37,554 --> 00:05:38,729
- No, no, no. No!
- No, Pheebs, no. We said!

38
00:05:38,903 --> 00:05:39,817
Not during rush hour.
No gunner seat.

39
00:05:53,222 --> 00:05:54,702
Ugh. Gross.

40
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:56,791
It's the Hell's Kitchen
Sewer Dragon.

41
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,709
Hold on to your ass!

42
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,672
- I'm going out.
- Phoebe.

43
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:11,066
- What, Callie?
- I'm Mom. You call me Mom.

44
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,720
Call me Gary,
or whatever you want.

45
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:14,678
- I-I don't care.
- We're gonna lose him.

46
00:06:14,852 --> 00:06:17,464
Phoebe Spengler,
you stay inside this car.

47
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:19,161
I have a ghost to bust.

48
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,731
All right. That was cool.

49
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:25,515
- Gary, come on.
- No, I know. I'm sorry.

50
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,038
It's just, the way she said it,
it sounded cool.

51
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,825
Get back in here!

52
00:06:30,999 --> 00:06:33,175
I can't hear you
over the nuclear accelerator.

53
00:06:47,972 --> 00:06:49,017
Whoa!

54
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:52,847
- Drop it!
-Okay. Maybe a "please."

55
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:01,812
- I'm sweating bullets.

56
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,165
In pursuit.

57
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:08,558
Nah.

58
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,907
They got it.

59
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:15,478
These roads are screwed.

60
00:07:15,652 --> 00:07:17,175
- Try driving a ten-ton hearse.
- I have.

61
00:07:17,349 --> 00:07:18,612
And if you give me the keys,

62
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:19,874
- then maybe we...
- Not now, Trevor.

63
00:07:23,051 --> 00:07:24,095
Now! Trevor!

64
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,488
Pop it, Trev!

65
00:07:38,719 --> 00:07:40,721
- I'm out of range.
- On it.

66
00:07:47,205 --> 00:07:48,729
Good luck, Mom.

67
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:57,564
- Come on.

68
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,670
- Later, gator.

69
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:23,372
Got it!

70
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:24,329
- You got it?
- Yeah! Got it!

71
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,506
- Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

72
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,072
- Whoo!

73
00:08:28,246 --> 00:08:29,596
Phoebe!

74
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,880
Everyone okay?
Oh, God.

75
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,448
Who puts bikes there?

76
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,850
The city ground
to a halt today

77
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,244
as a high-speed ghost chase
tore up

78
00:09:09,418 --> 00:09:10,637
portions of Lower Manhattan.

79
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,203
Honestly, looking at this,

80
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:13,770
I'm surprised
nobody got killed.

81
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:14,815
We haven't seen
the Ghostbusters

82
00:09:14,989 --> 00:09:16,294
cause this much damage since

83
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:19,646
the Statue of Liberty
debacle of 1989.

84
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:21,256
Last year, descendants of

85
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,127
original Ghostbusters founder
Egon Spengler

86
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:26,130
were handed the keys
to the derelict firehouse,

87
00:09:26,304 --> 00:09:27,654
bankrolled by philanthropist

88
00:09:27,828 --> 00:09:30,004
and former Ghostbuster
Winston Zeddemore.

89
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:33,181
And though it's been decades
since New Yorkers cheered...

90
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:34,617
♪ Ghostbusters! ♪

91
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,054
Break out the new equipment!

92
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:38,969
The Nutrona Blaster charged!

93
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,710
...today's question
isn't, "Who you gonna call?"

94
00:09:40,884 --> 00:09:43,408
It's, "Who's gonna pay
for this mess?"

95
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,498
Three lampposts,
two parked Priuses,

96
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,110
an entire fleet
of rental bikes.

97
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:53,331
That is a lot of damage.

98
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,551
Yeah, but you can't have
a Sewer Dragon

99
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,422
flying around SoHo
like it's Middle-earth.

100
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,991
You have someone hanging out
the side of a moving vehicle,

101
00:10:01,165 --> 00:10:03,385
firing a laser gun
indiscriminately...

102
00:10:03,559 --> 00:10:06,170
Laser gun? What?
That's a proton pack.

103
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,519
It's a weapon.

104
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:08,608
A weapon of science.

105
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,305
It's completely safe.

106
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,698
It's not completely safe.

107
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:13,569
It's a portable
proton accelerator.

108
00:10:13,743 --> 00:10:15,049
How old are you?

109
00:10:15,223 --> 00:10:16,398
I'm 18. I'm an adult.

110
00:10:16,572 --> 00:10:18,269
I'm not talking to you. Her.

111
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:22,273
- Fifteen.
- A minor.

112
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,362
We don't let kids become cops,

113
00:10:24,536 --> 00:10:26,060
we don't let them fight fires,

114
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:29,193
and we certainly don't let them
become Ghostbusters.

115
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,065
- Uh, Mister-Mister...
- Sir.

116
00:10:31,239 --> 00:10:32,980
I-I'm sorry. Uh, Mr. Mayor,
m-may I approach the bench?

117
00:10:33,154 --> 00:10:35,852
Do you see a robe?
I am not a judge.

118
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:41,902
Gary.

119
00:10:42,076 --> 00:10:45,645
Uh, look, uh, y-you don't know
Phoebe Spengler like-like I do.

120
00:10:45,819 --> 00:10:48,125
I mean, she is something else,
this kid.

121
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,780
Honestly, she's more focused,
more accomplished,

122
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:53,304
more capable than just about
any other adult I know.

123
00:10:53,478 --> 00:10:57,091
And what exactly is your
relationship to this minor?

124
00:10:57,613 --> 00:10:59,049
Are you her parent?

125
00:10:59,528 --> 00:11:00,703
I mean...

126
00:11:01,617 --> 00:11:03,793
Labels.
No, I'm her step-teacher.

127
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,404
Mr. Grooberson,
you are not her father.

128
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:07,841
You are her employer.

129
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:09,407
No, uh, we don't pay her.

130
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:11,714
Sounds like we can add
child labor

131
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:12,933
- to our list of violations.
- Uh...

132
00:11:13,107 --> 00:11:14,717
- Gary.
-Yeah.

133
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,937
Maybe she can become
a junior Ghostbuster,

134
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:19,156
hand out stickers or something.

135
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:20,810
As for the rest of you,

136
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:22,812
I am personally holding you
responsible,

137
00:11:22,986 --> 00:11:26,773
and I won't stop until
that firehouse you call a home

138
00:11:26,947 --> 00:11:28,383
is a pile of bricks.

139
00:11:35,346 --> 00:11:36,391
Mom?

140
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,045
The ceiling's leaking again.

141
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:39,699
Sounds like a fun mystery
for a boy detective.

142
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:40,961
Yeah, the mystery
of the black mold.

143
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:42,789
Super fun mystery,
and you're gone.

144
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,878
- Awesome. Awesome.

145
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:48,011
- Flight suit.
-It's not fair.

146
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,840
Maybe you can spend the next few
years being an actual teenager.

147
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,320
Yeah, well,
if this was the 18th century,

148
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:53,800
then I'd already be
a part of the workforce

149
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:54,931
and I'd have four kids.

150
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:57,586
Aw. So I'd be a grandmother.

151
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,328
No, you would be dead.

152
00:12:00,502 --> 00:12:03,157
So sweet.
A ghost grandma.

153
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:04,941
- Ooh, tacos.
- Ooh.

154
00:12:05,115 --> 00:12:06,769
Hey, look what I found
for movie night.

155
00:12:06,943 --> 00:12:08,075
Is that family friendly?

156
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:09,772
I hope not.

157
00:12:09,946 --> 00:12:11,426
It's about a family--
a family that eats people.

158
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,819
They're sisters.

159
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,298
- Trap.
- If that counts for anything.

160
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:15,778
I'm gonna take this
to the labor board.

161
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:16,779
- On what grounds?
- I'm a Ghostbuster.

162
00:12:16,953 --> 00:12:18,346
I saved the world.

163
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,695
Well, I like to think
we saved the world.

164
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:21,479
Hey, could you, uh,
watch my beans?

165
00:12:21,653 --> 00:12:23,090
You were a possessed canine.

166
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:25,309
-Ghost dog!

167
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,921
This is insane.

168
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:30,575
Man, they got into
the snacks again!

169
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,925
So you're gonna make me wait
till I'm 18?

170
00:12:32,099 --> 00:12:33,709
Aw, it's just three years.

171
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:35,624
- Be young. Live a little.
-This is the time

172
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,974
in your life when it's okay to
screw up, make some mistakes.

173
00:12:38,148 --> 00:12:40,063
Yeah, you have the rest of
your life to be a Ghostbuster.

174
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:41,935
Okay, well, three years
is nothing for you guys.

175
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:44,546
It's a tiny, negligible
percentage of your lifespan.

176
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,113
- She means we're old.
- Yeah, I got that.

177
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:48,028
You're not the only
Spengler here, you know.

178
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:49,551
Okay, well, this is my calling.

179
00:12:49,725 --> 00:12:51,945
You just, like, decided
to be a Ghostbuster.

180
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,511
So did I.

181
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:55,557
I mean, I was studying
earthquakes in Oklahoma.

182
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:57,037
Then I went to dinner
with your mom and...

183
00:12:57,211 --> 00:12:58,647
- ...we turned into dogs.

184
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:00,301
And fulfilled
an ancient prophecy

185
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:01,519
that almost brought about
the end of the world.

186
00:13:01,693 --> 00:13:02,869
Now, that's a first date.

187
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:04,827
We both got some action.

188
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,873
- Yeah, we did.
- Okay, gross.

189
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:09,266
For you, I get it--
you're a scientist--

190
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,790
but... she's just...

191
00:13:10,964 --> 00:13:13,488
Choose your next words
very carefully.

192
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:18,188
I didn't think
she even knew those words.

193
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,060
You could've backed me up.
It's great you're their buddy,

194
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:22,410
but sometimes you need
to be an asshole.

195
00:13:22,584 --> 00:13:24,064
Well, is that really my place?

196
00:13:24,238 --> 00:13:25,239
I hope so.

197
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:27,110
I... You know.

198
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:28,372
I want to be more
than just their buddy.

199
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:30,070
I just don't know
what's allowed.

200
00:13:31,332 --> 00:13:32,550
Permission granted.

201
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:35,423
Okay. Great.

202
00:13:37,164 --> 00:13:40,254
Although I got to warn you,
I mean, I can be scary.

203
00:13:40,428 --> 00:13:41,559
Yeah, you're a monster.

204
00:13:43,257 --> 00:13:45,128
You have no i...

205
00:13:45,302 --> 00:13:47,217
- Don't look at me that way.

206
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,829
You laugh... Hey!
You laughing in my face?!

207
00:13:50,003 --> 00:13:51,831
I'm so sorry.
That was really bad.

208
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:54,964
I-I scare myself sometimes.
I'll be nice to you.

209
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,574
I'll just be an asshole
to your kids.

210
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:58,228
That's what I want.

211
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:00,274
All right, who's hungry?

212
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,768
Is the containment unit okay?

213
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,206
Come on, there's always room
for one more ghost.

214
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,776
When the...
when the light is green...

215
00:14:24,951 --> 00:14:26,996
Come on!

216
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,868
When the light is green...

217
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:39,879
- The trap is clean.

218
00:14:48,148 --> 00:14:50,454
We're rolling in three, two...

219
00:14:53,283 --> 00:14:57,984
Greetings, ethereal beings,
subhuman entities

220
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,030
and spectral forms
from the great beyond

221
00:15:01,204 --> 00:15:04,468
and any living humans
who may be watching.

222
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:07,732
Welcome to "Repossessed,"
the show where we measure

223
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,387
the spiritual energy
of everyday objects.

224
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:14,174
I'm your host,
Dr. Raymond Stantz.

225
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:18,526
My, uh, young producer-intern
reminds me to ask you

226
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,789
that if you like
what you see here,

227
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,922
- please push...
Like.

228
00:15:23,096 --> 00:15:25,837
- Like... and subscribe.
- And subscribe.

229
00:15:26,012 --> 00:15:28,014
Now, who do we have here?

230
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:33,454
- Oh.

231
00:15:33,628 --> 00:15:36,587
I brought my late husband
Harold's watch.

232
00:15:37,675 --> 00:15:39,373
He wore it every day.

233
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:41,679
And now when I walk
in the room...

234
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:45,074
it beeps.

235
00:15:45,248 --> 00:15:47,903
Well, any object
that's been exposed

236
00:15:48,077 --> 00:15:52,038
to a deep emotional experience
can bind a spirit.

237
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,430
I see.

238
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:54,997
An organic ghost trap,
if you will.

239
00:15:55,171 --> 00:15:57,173
The stronger the experience
or even trauma,

240
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:58,740
the more powerful the trap.

241
00:15:58,914 --> 00:16:01,525
- Wow.
- The way we detect this energy

242
00:16:02,222 --> 00:16:03,788
is with one of these babies.

243
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,965
Oh, thank you.

244
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,836
- If there's anything there...
- Mm-hmm.

245
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,403
...this item will detect it.

246
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:17,063
Harold, beep for the nice man.

247
00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:21,371
Are you getting anything?

248
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:23,983
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but it seems that

249
00:16:24,157 --> 00:16:27,421
your dearly departed spirit has
left this earthly dimension.

250
00:16:29,727 --> 00:16:30,598
- Sorry, lady.

251
00:16:30,772 --> 00:16:32,034
The hammer gets the views.

252
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:34,428
He was gone anyway. Next!

253
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:38,519
I'm telling you,

254
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:40,782
it's gonna be
another hot one out there.

255
00:16:40,956 --> 00:16:42,088
- In fact...

256
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:44,090
- Hey, Dr. Ray.
- Phoebe!

257
00:16:44,264 --> 00:16:46,048
- Hot one.
-Yeah.

258
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,398
Um, here's the sample
of mood slime you requested.

259
00:16:48,572 --> 00:16:50,009
Oh. Put it downstairs.

260
00:16:50,183 --> 00:16:52,272
Here, I'll show you.

261
00:16:52,446 --> 00:16:55,144
So, you're, like,
sleeping down here?

262
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:57,233
Yeah. Normally,
Ray rents this place

263
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,714
to Norwegian ghost hunting
clubs on Booking.com,

264
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,455
and I just got lucky.

265
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,892
It sure beats another
boring summer in Dorklahoma.

266
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,068
So, catch anything crazy
lately?

267
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:07,417
Anything try to bite
your arm off,

268
00:17:07,591 --> 00:17:09,593
- like Class Five, Class Seven?

269
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:10,899
No, I've been benched.

270
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,642
Oh, hold on.

271
00:17:17,514 --> 00:17:20,126
Mm. I told my parents
I was at Space Camp.

272
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:24,565
We are go for launch.

273
00:17:24,739 --> 00:17:27,307
- T-minus 15,

274
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:30,440
14, 13, 12...

275
00:17:30,614 --> 00:17:31,920
Hi.

276
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,575
Hi.

277
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:36,881
Orbit. I'll talk to you guys
later. Love you. Bye.

278
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,970
...seven, six...

279
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,755
- Yeah.

280
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:49,155
- What are you doing?
- It's a nightmare.

281
00:17:50,808 --> 00:17:53,159
Ray smuggled them back
from Summerville.

282
00:17:55,161 --> 00:17:57,032
I'm pretty sure they're mating.

283
00:18:10,524 --> 00:18:11,568
Disgusting.

284
00:18:23,363 --> 00:18:25,539
That's odd.

285
00:18:28,194 --> 00:18:30,500
You the weird guy
who buys strange old things?

286
00:18:31,284 --> 00:18:33,373
Yeah, correct on both counts.

287
00:18:33,547 --> 00:18:36,071
Buddy, you just hit
the jackpot.

288
00:18:36,245 --> 00:18:38,029
This is all stuff
from my grandmother's.

289
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:41,076
And it was passed down to her,
so it's, like, ancient-ancient.

290
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,773
Was she a believer?

291
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,297
Well, she believed
a lot of demented

292
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,081
and superstitious stuff,
if that's what you mean.

293
00:18:46,255 --> 00:18:47,996
My kind of gal.

294
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,911
I've learned it's always best
to knock every piece of wood

295
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,521
and throw a coin
into every fountain.

296
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:53,088
You just never know.

297
00:18:53,262 --> 00:18:54,872
Well, I think you lose
a lot of coins that way.

298
00:18:55,046 --> 00:18:57,571
- That's interesting stuff.
- It sure is.

299
00:18:58,224 --> 00:18:59,703
30 for the whole lot?

300
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:01,792
This one's nice.

301
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,142
Oh.

302
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:04,882
Hmm.

303
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,892
Oh, the glyphs on this.

304
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:16,894
Oh, yeah. The glyph one.

305
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:18,200
You know your stuff, man.

306
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:20,115
That's the special piece
in there.

307
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:21,595
Actually, it's in there
by mistake.

308
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,598
I can't part with it...
for less than 50 bucks.

309
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,426
Mezzo-Arabic?

310
00:19:27,296 --> 00:19:29,820
Yeah. Mezzo-Arabic.

311
00:19:29,994 --> 00:19:31,953
Very unique.

312
00:19:32,954 --> 00:19:34,651
Sixty.

313
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:38,568
These kinds of brass objects
were used to trap evil spirits.

314
00:19:38,742 --> 00:19:40,918
Oh, you think there's
something inside it?

315
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,269
No clue.

316
00:19:43,443 --> 00:19:44,879
If there is something trapped
in here,

317
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:47,186
you can bet
it's for a good reason.

318
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:49,057
Definitely.

319
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:51,146
I'm gonna take a PKE reading.

320
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,017
Psychokinetic energy meter.

321
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,323
May I do that?

322
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,369
Thank you for asking.

323
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,979
So many places do that
without asking.

324
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:01,765
Oh.

325
00:20:02,418 --> 00:20:03,811
Instant reaction.

326
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:06,727
Whoa. Whoa.

327
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:10,948
Are you above the subway line?

328
00:20:31,186 --> 00:20:32,405
Off-the-chart
telekinetic energy!

329
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:34,320
Full-bore convective spatter!

330
00:20:34,494 --> 00:20:35,843
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

331
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:37,714
I'll take the works.

332
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:39,368
Sorry, I don't have change.

333
00:20:40,326 --> 00:20:42,328
- Are you okay?

334
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,249
Okay. Okay. Okay.

335
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,520
I'm telling you,
I mean, this...

336
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,696
This wasn't here before.

337
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,264
It shook the whole place.

338
00:21:05,438 --> 00:21:07,570
Has anyone ever emptied
this containment unit?

339
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,964
- Where, Gary? The East River?

340
00:21:10,138 --> 00:21:13,707
So you've just been stuffing
ghosts in there since 1984?

341
00:21:13,881 --> 00:21:15,404
That's the idea.

342
00:21:15,578 --> 00:21:18,364
All right.
Well, maybe not the best idea.

343
00:21:18,538 --> 00:21:21,497
I'll let Winston's engineers
know about this.

344
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,804
Hey, by the way,
about Winston's engineers.

345
00:21:23,978 --> 00:21:25,545
Um, who are they?

346
00:21:25,719 --> 00:21:27,286
Oh, that's not for me to say.

347
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,983
No, but what are they
working on?

348
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:31,986
Is it supersecret underground
ghostbusting stuff?

349
00:21:33,204 --> 00:21:35,250
That's right, Gary.

350
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:39,167
Supersecret underground
ghostbusting stuff.

351
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:40,560
I knew it.

352
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:56,793
Ugh.

353
00:21:58,665 --> 00:21:59,927
Mom!

354
00:22:01,624 --> 00:22:04,366
Mom.
There's something in the attic.

355
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,194
You're an adult, right?

356
00:22:06,368 --> 00:22:07,500
Yeah.

357
00:22:07,674 --> 00:22:09,589
Then why don't you
take care of it?

358
00:22:10,241 --> 00:22:11,330
Okay.

359
00:22:11,504 --> 00:22:12,896
Yeah, sure. I will.

360
00:22:13,984 --> 00:22:15,464
I will take care of it.

361
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:17,858
Do that right now.

362
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,428
- Ow.

363
00:22:35,658 --> 00:22:37,965
You picked
the wrong house, bro.

364
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:09,692
What the actual hell?

365
00:23:34,325 --> 00:23:36,023
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

366
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,512
- Yeah.

367
00:23:46,686 --> 00:23:48,078
-Be safe.
-Thanks.

368
00:23:48,252 --> 00:23:49,428
Where do you think
you're going?

369
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:50,690
You're seriously not taking me?

370
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,170
- Don't look at him.
- I, uh...

371
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,563
- Gary.
- Thanks for the support.

372
00:23:54,737 --> 00:23:55,999
- Sorry.
-What happened to you?

373
00:23:56,173 --> 00:23:57,523
It's nothing.
I can handle it.

374
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:58,567
Did you shower,
or is that product?

375
00:23:58,741 --> 00:23:59,612
What? I'm a Ghostbuster.

376
00:23:59,786 --> 00:24:01,004
Ha-ha. Very funny.

377
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:38,101
Boo.

378
00:25:41,104 --> 00:25:42,149
Oh.

379
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,326
Uh, hey.

380
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:49,678
You know I'm a ghost, right?

381
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,114
Kind of figured
when the chess pieces

382
00:25:51,288 --> 00:25:52,725
started moving on their own.

383
00:25:56,467 --> 00:25:57,730
And you're not...

384
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:00,559
terrified of me?

385
00:26:01,342 --> 00:26:03,605
No. Should I be?

386
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:04,911
I just think it's kind of weird.

387
00:26:05,085 --> 00:26:07,217
I mean, usually,
people run by now.

388
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:10,307
I can leave if you want.

389
00:26:10,481 --> 00:26:11,831
No, I'm not saying
you have to go.

390
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:13,572
If you want to, like,
float away again,

391
00:26:13,746 --> 00:26:15,051
- I can pretend that I'm scared.
- No, I-I'm not saying...

392
00:26:17,663 --> 00:26:18,838
Still weird.

393
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,321
Nice flames, by the way.

394
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:26,846
Thanks.

395
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,152
Yeah, I burned alive
in a horrifying tenement fire.

396
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:31,677
Guess you're lucky that
you're not all crispy.

397
00:26:31,851 --> 00:26:34,027
I died before
my face melted off.

398
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:35,202
That's a bonus.

399
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:42,601
Checkmate.

400
00:26:44,385 --> 00:26:46,039
What? I-I don't understand.

401
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,214
I-I can tell.

402
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:49,651
Hey, don't take it too hard.

403
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:52,306
I've had a lot of time
to practice.

404
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:55,135
So, you got a name?

405
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:56,223
Phoebe.

406
00:26:56,397 --> 00:26:57,920
I'm Melody.

407
00:26:58,094 --> 00:27:01,054
- Cool name.
- Thanks. It was a family name.

408
00:27:01,228 --> 00:27:02,795
I was being sarcastic.

409
00:27:05,188 --> 00:27:06,712
I kind of like you.

410
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:14,371
What's the worst part
about being a ghost?

411
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:18,027
I'll be 16
for the rest of eternity.

412
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,856
Yikes. No matter what?

413
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:23,076
Unless I...

414
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,905
complete
my unfinished business.

415
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,264
Then what is the best part?

416
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:41,747
Doing this.

417
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:08,774
Um, do you mind just...

418
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:10,645
Yeah.

419
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:16,085
So you're
one of Winston's guys, huh?

420
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,609
- Gary.
- Hmm? Sorry.

421
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,307
Does that help you
hear the ghosts?

422
00:28:20,481 --> 00:28:23,397
Oh, what helps me listen
to the ghosts is silence.

423
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:26,487
Sorry.

424
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,889
Okay. All right,
is something trying to get out?

425
00:28:37,672 --> 00:28:38,934
Many things.

426
00:28:43,243 --> 00:28:45,245
Is this my dad's handwriting?

427
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,160
His design.

428
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:49,858
The containment unit is
essentially a large ghost trap.

429
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:51,860
That was Egon Spengler's
great vision.

430
00:28:52,034 --> 00:28:53,862
An articulated stream
of protons

431
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:56,038
that could stabilize
the particles of a ghost.

432
00:28:56,212 --> 00:28:58,301
- Are you following this?
- Yeah, of course I am.

433
00:28:58,475 --> 00:29:00,869
After 40 years of compiling
spiritual waste...

434
00:29:01,043 --> 00:29:02,218
You ran out of space.

435
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:03,829
Well, didn't anybody
see this coming?

436
00:29:04,003 --> 00:29:05,352
It was the '80s.

437
00:29:05,526 --> 00:29:08,355
Nobody was too worried
about the future.

438
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,400
Then this happened.

439
00:29:11,053 --> 00:29:12,228
This momentary burst

440
00:29:12,402 --> 00:29:14,100
of spiritual energy
created a rift.

441
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:18,365
It's a potential gateway
to the other side.

442
00:29:19,192 --> 00:29:20,541
The other side?

443
00:29:21,411 --> 00:29:22,935
Are we talking about...

444
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:25,720
I don't know
what we're talking about.

445
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:27,417
That's what scares me.

446
00:29:27,591 --> 00:29:32,118
Look, we didn't just buy
the firehouse for nostalgia.

447
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:35,469
This building
is the finger in the dam.

448
00:29:35,643 --> 00:29:37,166
It's the fortification between

449
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,952
everything we do
and don't understand.

450
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:42,128
We have to protect it.

451
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:45,000
O-Okay,
so the ghost compactor broke.

452
00:29:45,174 --> 00:29:47,220
Can't you guys
just build a new one?

453
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:48,743
What-what do you mean?

454
00:29:48,917 --> 00:29:50,440
What do you mean,
"what do you mean?"

455
00:29:51,485 --> 00:29:52,791
Don't they know?

456
00:29:54,357 --> 00:29:55,489
We already have.

457
00:29:58,274 --> 00:29:59,928
WINSTON [VOICE-OVER]: While
you've been out busting ghosts,

458
00:30:00,102 --> 00:30:02,931
my engineers have been
thinking about our future.

459
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:08,284
Once upon a time, this was
the Triborough Aquarium.

460
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:11,418
Most recently, it's been
more of a squatters' paradise

461
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:12,723
and rave venue.

462
00:30:19,426 --> 00:30:23,734
Welcome to
the Paranormal Research Center.

463
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:26,128
Ghostbusting asks
a lot of questions,

464
00:30:26,302 --> 00:30:29,305
and now we have a place
to find the answers.

465
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:31,655
We have a parabotanist.

466
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,397
We even have
a paramusicologist.

467
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:35,616
Hey, Lucky!

468
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,012
Lucky!

469
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:50,457
- Trevor?
- Hey! You're here.

470
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,288
Uh, when you said
you were interning,

471
00:30:55,462 --> 00:30:56,767
I didn't know you'd be
blowing stuff away with lasers.

472
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:58,291
I know, right?
Just a little upgrade.

473
00:30:58,465 --> 00:31:00,075
Of course, you all know Lars,

474
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:02,861
our resident parabiologist.

475
00:31:03,035 --> 00:31:04,471
Oh, no way.

476
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:05,733
I used to have one of these.

477
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:09,389
Mind your fingers.

478
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,436
It's possessed
by an evil Spin Doctors CD.

479
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,177
Ray Stantz has generously

480
00:31:15,351 --> 00:31:19,007
provided us with a collection
of spirit-loaded items.

481
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:21,749
So, everything
in this place is haunted?

482
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,359
Indeed.

483
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,405
Look, here's a rare find.

484
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:28,016
This grandfather clock
is inhabited by the spirit

485
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:29,975
of an actual grandfather.

486
00:31:34,414 --> 00:31:37,243
Any emotionally charged object
can contain a ghost,

487
00:31:37,417 --> 00:31:40,768
as long as it's experienced
some sort of horrific event.

488
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,378
By exciting the atoms,
we're able to create

489
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:45,033
a fluid moment
of chemical transition.

490
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:47,862
Then we simply lock
onto the spirit...

491
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:51,866
...extract it
from its host object...

492
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:11,103
...and then lovingly deposit it
into our second chamber...

493
00:32:13,235 --> 00:32:16,021
...so it can be
properly disposed of.

494
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,203
Have you made any attempts
on living possession?

495
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:26,509
Oh, w-we're still tweaking.

496
00:32:31,819 --> 00:32:34,126
Now, I didn't want
to show it until it was ready,

497
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:37,781
but this is what
I brought you here to see.

498
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,306
Our new containment unit,

499
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,265
based on Egon's
original design.

500
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:46,747
It can spin the equivalent
of 50 million cubic hectares

501
00:32:46,921 --> 00:32:49,010
of plasmic confinement.

502
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:51,491
A psychic jail as big
as the American West.

503
00:32:52,231 --> 00:32:53,754
"Home on the Strange."

504
00:32:53,928 --> 00:32:56,583
Oh. Where the specters
and entities play.

505
00:32:56,757 --> 00:32:58,498
- Where the...
- Yeah.

506
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,717
How long would it take
to move the ghosts

507
00:33:00,891 --> 00:33:02,415
from the firehouse to here?

508
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:04,243
If we went trap by trap
on regular shifts,

509
00:33:04,417 --> 00:33:07,681
it could take anywhere between
three to seven years.

510
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,552
Oh, so...
so soon-ish.

511
00:33:09,726 --> 00:33:11,119
Oh, I almost forgot.

512
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:12,860
We don't exactly know
what it is,

513
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,514
but it broke the PKE meter.

514
00:33:14,688 --> 00:33:16,733
Good luck extracting
whatever's inside it.

515
00:33:16,907 --> 00:33:18,257
Fun.

516
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:19,780
Yeah, we're still
workshopping names.

517
00:33:19,954 --> 00:33:21,521
Uh, I personally like
the Little Ball of Hate

518
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,479
or Devil's Testicle.

519
00:33:23,653 --> 00:33:25,568
Thank you, Podcast.

520
00:33:25,742 --> 00:33:27,309
Yeah. You're welcome.

521
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:37,537
- What's in here?

522
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:41,149
Wait, do you keep ghosts
just hanging out in here?

523
00:33:41,323 --> 00:33:42,759
We spent a long time
trapping them.

524
00:33:42,933 --> 00:33:44,283
Now we can study them.

525
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:46,241
Why don't they escape?

526
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:48,896
- Barrier of proton fields.
-Precisely.

527
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:51,159
It's the same technology
as in your packs.

528
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:53,422
We use it
in all the enclosures.

529
00:33:57,122 --> 00:33:59,863
- Oh.
He's cute.

530
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,127
- Yeah.
- Hey, buddy.

531
00:34:06,479 --> 00:34:07,784
Now, this one is the most

532
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,177
threatening pest
in the whole complex.

533
00:34:09,351 --> 00:34:11,484
- Possessor.

534
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:14,313
This spry little weasel

535
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:17,055
can occupy any inanimate matter
it wants.

536
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,669
Extremely dangerous.

537
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:41,818
Hey.

538
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:50,218
You're good.

539
00:35:10,804 --> 00:35:13,023
Pheebs.
Am I doing something wrong?

540
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:14,460
It's not working.

541
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:16,201
Can you help me?

542
00:35:17,506 --> 00:35:20,466
The cyclotron isn't... cycling.

543
00:35:22,729 --> 00:35:23,904
Can you help me out?

544
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:29,692
- Whoa.

545
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:31,216
You fixed it.

546
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,739
- Literally just unplugged.

547
00:35:35,568 --> 00:35:37,918
I know it sucks right now.
I-I do.

548
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:41,748
But it's just temporary.
And time flies by.

549
00:35:41,922 --> 00:35:44,011
I promise you. I should know.

550
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:45,578
Two years ago,
I was in Oklahoma,

551
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:47,623
and now I'm here...

552
00:35:47,797 --> 00:35:49,538
with a proton pack.

553
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:52,411
I was your
science teacher, and now I'm...

554
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,372
Well, now I'm...

555
00:35:57,546 --> 00:36:00,114
- And I'm your, um...

556
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:02,247
We got a call downtown!

557
00:36:02,725 --> 00:36:04,205
Trev, let's go!

558
00:36:06,729 --> 00:36:07,730
Sorry.

559
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:38,631
Hello? Anybody there?

560
00:36:38,805 --> 00:36:40,589
Gh-Ghostbusters.

561
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:42,809
Oh, good.
We need someone right away.

562
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,646
All right.

563
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,256
We're back, baby.

564
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:57,824
Ghostbusters are back.
Back in the big city.

565
00:36:57,998 --> 00:36:59,347
Back in the Big Apple.

566
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,349
Gonna take a bite
out of the Big Apple.

567
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:03,221
Phoebe, Podcast.

568
00:37:03,395 --> 00:37:04,744
Podcast and Phoebe.
Can't keep us apart.

569
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,311
Dynamic duo.

570
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:07,790
What are we catching tonight?

571
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:36,123
Can't play right now.

572
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,519
I know you see me working.

573
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:44,479
If you're good, later on,
you'll get a tennis ball.

574
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,529
Let's see
what you've got in you.

575
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,723
Something wrong?

576
00:38:21,603 --> 00:38:24,127
I think it's
fighting extraction.

577
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,825
Not for this long. The...

578
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,404
- Uh...
- Okay.

579
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:41,014
- Small thing.
- Uh-huh.

580
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:43,103
Need to wait for the generators
to warm back up.

581
00:38:43,277 --> 00:38:44,626
Until then...

582
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:47,499
the proton fields are down.

583
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,198
Okay. Uh...

584
00:38:53,809 --> 00:38:55,115
Do you hear that?

585
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:18,138
Lars. Why haven't the ghosts
escaped yet?

586
00:39:30,803 --> 00:39:32,805
Okay, we need to shut
that thing up.

587
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:50,518
This is the place.

588
00:39:51,171 --> 00:39:52,390
Yeah.

589
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,089
They better have baklava.

590
00:40:03,836 --> 00:40:05,054
Hi.

591
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:06,491
You here for the ghost?

592
00:40:24,683 --> 00:40:25,684
Boo.

593
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,338
Phoebe?

594
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,036
- Uh...
- Blast it.

595
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,777
"It"?

596
00:40:31,951 --> 00:40:33,474
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Who's the third wheel?

597
00:40:33,648 --> 00:40:35,520
Why are you just
standing there? Fire!

598
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:37,086
Uh...

599
00:40:39,567 --> 00:40:40,699
What are you doing?!

600
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:42,614
- You missed!
-Oh!

601
00:41:23,393 --> 00:41:25,613
- If... I have great aim.
- Cool.

602
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:27,833
And if I wanted to hit you,
then I would've, but I didn't.

603
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:29,443
- Right.
- If it...

604
00:41:29,617 --> 00:41:31,619
If it makes you
feel better, I guess.

605
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:34,622
Yeah, I just feel, like,
a warm rush of relief.

606
00:41:35,841 --> 00:41:36,798
Oh.

607
00:41:38,104 --> 00:41:39,497
Phew.

608
00:41:40,062 --> 00:41:41,194
So...

609
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:43,588
do you want to hang out?

610
00:41:43,762 --> 00:41:45,503
You're inviting me in?

611
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:50,638
Um, sure. Yeah.

612
00:41:50,812 --> 00:41:52,031
You're inviting me inside

613
00:41:52,205 --> 00:41:54,163
your ghost extermination
headquarters?

614
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:57,471
Uh, yeah, no, it's fine.
I see how that could be weird.

615
00:41:57,645 --> 00:41:59,299
It's cool. You don't have to...

616
00:41:59,473 --> 00:42:00,692
Nice digs.

617
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:05,218
You can transapparate?

618
00:42:05,392 --> 00:42:07,133
Oh, is that what I just did?

619
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:08,787
Yeah, I do that.

620
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,354
How do you touch
the chess pieces if...?

621
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,878
Basically, I exist on

622
00:42:13,052 --> 00:42:14,444
an entirely different
dimensional plane.

623
00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:15,881
You wouldn't get it.

624
00:42:16,055 --> 00:42:17,839
I get it.
I love dimensional planes.

625
00:42:18,013 --> 00:42:20,320
I've always wanted to visit
a different dimensional plane.

626
00:42:20,494 --> 00:42:22,148
I don't know why
I said that. I...

627
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:30,069
So, like, is the rest
of this place this cool or...?

628
00:42:35,161 --> 00:42:36,641
That's our car.

629
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:38,120
And...

630
00:42:39,208 --> 00:42:41,994
this is my locker.

631
00:42:42,168 --> 00:42:43,604
That's my name.

632
00:42:52,221 --> 00:42:54,180
Oh, uh, that's where we...

633
00:42:54,354 --> 00:42:56,095
I know what this is.

634
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:01,361
Have you ever wondered
what happens...

635
00:43:03,015 --> 00:43:04,886
...when we're all done here?

636
00:43:07,497 --> 00:43:08,673
I mean, I've seen it.

637
00:43:12,546 --> 00:43:14,330
Yeah, I mean, it's...

638
00:43:14,504 --> 00:43:16,202
it's really beautiful, actually.

639
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:19,422
I mean, your particles start
to lose their bonds

640
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,687
and float off into space.

641
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:25,254
Then what?

642
00:43:25,428 --> 00:43:26,821
Quantum physics suggests
that we become

643
00:43:26,995 --> 00:43:28,910
a part of the fabric
of the universe.

644
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:31,652
Do you believe that?

645
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,175
I mean, I believe
in quantum physics.

646
00:43:33,349 --> 00:43:35,047
Duh.

647
00:43:36,352 --> 00:43:37,702
Sounds cool.

648
00:43:37,876 --> 00:43:39,573
Maybe I'll be able
to check it out someday.

649
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:42,010
When you cross
to the other side?

650
00:43:43,055 --> 00:43:44,360
Yeah.

651
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:45,971
That's where my family is.

652
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:48,277
Why can't you join them?

653
00:43:49,104 --> 00:43:51,411
If I knew,
I'd already be there.

654
00:43:58,026 --> 00:44:00,072
Is, uh, that your object?

655
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:01,900
My what?

656
00:44:02,074 --> 00:44:03,945
It's like an emotionally
charged anchor

657
00:44:04,119 --> 00:44:06,774
that keeps us tethered
to this world.

658
00:44:06,948 --> 00:44:09,516
Well, the last match burned
my family alive, so...

659
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,258
Yeah, well, that'll do it.

660
00:44:12,432 --> 00:44:14,086
No, it was an accident.

661
00:44:16,697 --> 00:44:18,177
- Oh, I...
- I used to think

662
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,048
these matches were
some sort of key to moving on,

663
00:44:20,222 --> 00:44:24,052
but I've gotten used to the idea
that I'm not going anywhere.

664
00:44:26,098 --> 00:44:28,230
- I'm sorry.
-Pheebs?

665
00:44:30,232 --> 00:44:31,233
You okay down there?

666
00:44:31,407 --> 00:44:32,452
Um...

667
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,760
Uh, I'll be right up.

668
00:45:44,045 --> 00:45:45,568
I'm going as fast as I can.

669
00:45:49,877 --> 00:45:51,574
Does it have to be her?

670
00:45:57,624 --> 00:45:59,191
I understand.

671
00:46:28,481 --> 00:46:29,874
Hey, pal.

672
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:32,877
Got some Cheetos for you.

673
00:46:33,051 --> 00:46:35,444
You can come on out.

674
00:46:35,618 --> 00:46:38,056
I'm only gonna shoot you
in the face.

675
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,886
Come on.

676
00:47:06,606 --> 00:47:07,607
That's it.

677
00:47:10,697 --> 00:47:12,438
Huh? The hell?

678
00:47:18,052 --> 00:47:19,271
-Phoebe?

679
00:47:19,445 --> 00:47:20,707
- You okay?
- Yeah.

680
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:22,317
Basement. Now.

681
00:47:35,461 --> 00:47:36,941
Can you explain this?

682
00:47:39,769 --> 00:47:41,162
No, I can't.

683
00:47:52,478 --> 00:47:54,349
- Cool.
- Empirically.

684
00:47:54,523 --> 00:47:58,005
Approaching the mythically cold
temperature of absolute zero,

685
00:47:58,179 --> 00:48:00,573
the degree at which
all particles stop.

686
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:02,227
Zero kelvin.

687
00:48:02,401 --> 00:48:05,578
The suspension of life itself.
Exquisite.

688
00:48:05,752 --> 00:48:07,232
If you like that...

689
00:48:08,102 --> 00:48:10,539
- you're gonna love this.

690
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:20,767
Ever since you brought in
this lethal snow cone,

691
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:23,074
the other ghosts have been
acting peculiar.

692
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:24,771
We think it's communicating.

693
00:48:24,945 --> 00:48:26,381
So the orb's kind of chatty?

694
00:48:26,555 --> 00:48:28,253
Not the orb itself
but whatever lies within it.

695
00:48:28,427 --> 00:48:29,863
We think it's commanding
the other ghosts

696
00:48:30,037 --> 00:48:32,518
with some sort of mind control.

697
00:48:37,044 --> 00:48:38,567
All right.

698
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,845
- Wow.
Oh.

699
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:57,978
Extreme thermodynamic
"exutions,"

700
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,458
thought transference...

701
00:48:59,632 --> 00:49:01,286
This little cutie gets out,

702
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,505
no telling how dangerous
it could be.

703
00:49:07,248 --> 00:49:09,947
Where the hell did you guys
get this thing?

704
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:24,744
Hey, man.

705
00:49:24,918 --> 00:49:28,226
- Hey.
- Are you Nadeem Razmaadi?

706
00:49:29,357 --> 00:49:30,576
Maybe.

707
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,969
Did you recently sell
a collection

708
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:34,406
of family artifacts
to Ray Stantz?

709
00:49:36,886 --> 00:49:38,323
- That money's gone.
-Wait.

710
00:49:40,934 --> 00:49:43,197
Uh, we're not looking
for a refund. We...

711
00:49:43,371 --> 00:49:44,851
Come on in.

712
00:49:45,025 --> 00:49:46,548
I got a bunch of other stuff
for sale.

713
00:49:46,722 --> 00:49:50,161
I am a licensed third-party
reseller of sneakers.

714
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,293
- What's your shoe size, my man?
-Uh, ten.

715
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:54,556
I don't have any tens.
Can you squeeze into an eight?

716
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:57,168
- No, probably not.
- Is this your bachelor pad?

717
00:49:57,342 --> 00:50:00,345
This was my dadi's place--
my grandmother's.

718
00:50:00,519 --> 00:50:01,433
Hmm.

719
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,087
Nipple stuff.

720
00:50:03,261 --> 00:50:05,002
- Iconic.
-Oh, yeah.

721
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:06,612
That was my dadi's
favorite painting.

722
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:09,093
I can't really part with it.
What's your offer?

723
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:11,182
What was
your grandmother's deal?

724
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:14,141
We weren't really that close.
She said I was unambitious.

725
00:50:14,315 --> 00:50:15,664
But, really,
who's the brave one, huh?

726
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:17,101
The brother who goes
to engineering school

727
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:18,580
or the one who forges ahead

728
00:50:18,754 --> 00:50:21,061
with no education
or future prospects?

729
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:22,976
The second one.

730
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,543
- Right? Yeah.
-Yes. Absolutely.

731
00:50:24,717 --> 00:50:26,153
Yeah, I think that all the time.

732
00:50:26,327 --> 00:50:27,241
Yep. Me, too. I also think
that all the time.

733
00:50:27,415 --> 00:50:28,895
Hundred percent. It's heroic.

734
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:29,765
Yeah, we're curious about
a particular object.

735
00:50:29,939 --> 00:50:31,332
Brass orb.

736
00:50:31,898 --> 00:50:33,595
Hurts when touched.

737
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:36,076
Oh, yeah, that came from my
grandmother's special back room

738
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,687
where she keeps
all the really good stuff.

739
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:42,082
But I'm not supposed to take
anybody back there, so...

740
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:52,484
Whoa.

741
00:50:53,876 --> 00:50:55,226
Nice sex dungeon.

742
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,402
- Okay, dadi.
-Not a sex dungeon.

743
00:50:57,576 --> 00:50:59,186
Would a sex dungeon
have these chains?

744
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,709
- Yeah, definitely.
-Yeah.

745
00:51:00,883 --> 00:51:02,494
As soon as I said it,
I realized it would.

746
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:06,063
Seriously,
what'd she do in here?

747
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:08,021
I don't know. I found
this room after she died

748
00:51:08,195 --> 00:51:10,110
while I was looking
for some Pop-Tarts.

749
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:15,333
All this stuff is for sale, too,
by the way.

750
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:19,337
- Is this brass or copper, Lars?
- Brass.

751
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:21,513
Once believed to be
a magical alloy.

752
00:51:21,687 --> 00:51:22,992
There are countless tales

753
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,472
of demons trapped
in brass urns and lamps,

754
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:26,648
going all the way back
to the time of Solomon.

755
00:51:27,649 --> 00:51:29,651
Sick outfit.

756
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:35,309
Whoa. You guys hear that?

757
00:51:35,483 --> 00:51:37,268
- No echo, no anything.

758
00:51:37,442 --> 00:51:39,183
It's like... it's like
a dead room in here.

759
00:51:39,357 --> 00:51:40,880
So she could be as loud
as she wanted.

760
00:51:41,054 --> 00:51:42,099
-Please stop.

761
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:43,578
Please stop making sex jokes

762
00:51:43,752 --> 00:51:45,711
about my recently deceased
grandmother.

763
00:51:45,885 --> 00:51:48,888
The brass orb--
it was always kept in here?

764
00:51:49,062 --> 00:51:50,542
Far as I know.

765
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:52,848
Is it possible she wanted
to keep it quiet?

766
00:51:58,376 --> 00:51:59,725
What does that mean?

767
00:52:01,335 --> 00:52:02,815
It means you're coming with us.

768
00:52:04,077 --> 00:52:05,557
PHOEBE [VOICE-OVER]: Dr. Ray?

769
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:07,602
- Yes, Phoebe?
- I think that somebody left

770
00:52:07,776 --> 00:52:10,605
a rotting carrot
on one of your shelves.

771
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:11,954
Oh, that's a human pinkie.

772
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,695
- Picked that up

773
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:15,132
at the old State Hospital
for the Criminally Insane

774
00:52:15,306 --> 00:52:17,917
in Pennsylvania-- haunted.

775
00:52:18,091 --> 00:52:19,397
And we had no equipment
back then.

776
00:52:19,571 --> 00:52:21,050
- Um...
- We...

777
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:24,228
Actually, I had a question
I wanted to ask you.

778
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:28,362
Have you ever...

779
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:30,843
wondered what it would be like
to be a ghost?

780
00:52:33,933 --> 00:52:35,804
Every day of my life, dear.

781
00:52:36,892 --> 00:52:38,329
- Really?
- Sure.

782
00:52:38,503 --> 00:52:41,332
I mean,
how I would materialize.

783
00:52:42,071 --> 00:52:43,638
What's that feel like?

784
00:52:43,812 --> 00:52:45,684
Would it be some kind
of a visual manifestation?

785
00:52:45,858 --> 00:52:48,817
- I mean, if something's...

786
00:52:49,427 --> 00:52:51,080
What is that?

787
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:54,475
Oh, um, I was just watching
a video I shot of the orb.

788
00:52:54,649 --> 00:52:56,085
I think the audio's
corrupted or something.

789
00:52:56,260 --> 00:52:58,262
It's all weird. Here.

790
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:00,481
Check it out.

791
00:53:02,091 --> 00:53:04,790
Ancient verbiage, um...

792
00:53:04,964 --> 00:53:06,531
Yeah, but what language?

793
00:53:06,705 --> 00:53:07,793
A dead one.

794
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:11,275
I know a guy who could help us.

795
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:13,190
But...

796
00:53:15,801 --> 00:53:18,369
Should we investigate?

797
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:20,545
Mm, we could.

798
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:22,808
Aren't you benched?

799
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:24,636
Aren't you retired?

800
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:27,595
Oh.
You gonna take that from her?

801
00:53:46,484 --> 00:53:47,746
Hold still.

802
00:53:52,359 --> 00:53:53,969
What's this?

803
00:53:54,143 --> 00:53:56,320
It's just
a garden-variety test:

804
00:53:56,494 --> 00:53:59,148
Are you... a human?

805
00:53:59,323 --> 00:54:00,933
You should be able
to pass it easily

806
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:05,851
unless you are possessed
by a cross-dimensional beast.

807
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,550
Right, just a couple human
beings having a conversation.

808
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:12,553
One of them has a pasta pot
strapped to his head.

809
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:15,339
Let's start off
with a layup, okay?

810
00:54:17,732 --> 00:54:18,777
Puppies.

811
00:54:19,473 --> 00:54:22,389
Love them or kill them?

812
00:54:27,742 --> 00:54:28,961
I love them?

813
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,791
That's one correct.

814
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:36,316
Okay. Great.

815
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,623
Yes, but that was very easy.

816
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:43,628
Have you ever experienced
déjà vu?

817
00:54:44,542 --> 00:54:45,543
No.

818
00:54:45,847 --> 00:54:46,848
Okay.

819
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,242
Have you ever experienced...

820
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:50,809
Déjà vu?

821
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:54,508
- That's pretty good.

822
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,078
- Ow!

823
00:54:59,252 --> 00:55:00,949
What was that?

824
00:55:02,908 --> 00:55:05,214
Don't throw any more pens
at me, dude.

825
00:55:05,389 --> 00:55:07,086
That made you angry, did it?

826
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,915
Yeah, it made me angry, did it.

827
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:15,747
You're about
to devour a small child.

828
00:55:15,921 --> 00:55:19,707
Would you prefer skin on
or skinless?

829
00:55:22,493 --> 00:55:23,972
Okay. I'm not...

830
00:55:24,146 --> 00:55:25,931
This interview is over.
I'm not gonna answer that.

831
00:55:26,105 --> 00:55:27,976
- Refuse to answer that? Okay.
- No, no, no. I'm not refusing.

832
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,110
Okay. I'll do it. I'll do it.
Is it a human child?

833
00:55:31,284 --> 00:55:32,459
Are there other kinds
of children?

834
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:33,939
Are you thinking
of a specific child?

835
00:55:34,113 --> 00:55:35,680
Is this child related to me?

836
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:37,551
- Would that be necessary?
- No, it's not necessary.

837
00:55:37,725 --> 00:55:38,944
You're the one
who brought it up.

838
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:40,467
I don't want to eat any...

839
00:55:40,641 --> 00:55:42,339
- I told you to stop

840
00:55:42,513 --> 00:55:43,949
throwing pens at me.

841
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:45,951
I'm sorry. It's a perfectly
normal reaction!

842
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,996
Oh, oh! Don't! Okay! Okay!

843
00:55:51,522 --> 00:55:53,437
What are you staring at?!

844
00:56:00,095 --> 00:56:01,140
Did I pass?

845
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:19,376
Dr. Stantz, I don't think that
this is a legal parking space.

846
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:21,465
Ah, they know me here.

847
00:56:21,639 --> 00:56:22,814
Did you know
these two regal kittens

848
00:56:22,988 --> 00:56:24,206
actually have names?

849
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,165
You have Patience
and Fortitude.

850
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:27,819
Ah, no! Dr. Stantz!

851
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:29,821
No, you are forbidden
from coming within

852
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:31,649
50 feet of this library.

853
00:56:31,823 --> 00:56:33,999
Good to see you, buddy.
Been a long time, huh?

854
00:56:34,652 --> 00:56:35,566
Hi.

855
00:56:36,044 --> 00:56:37,002
Excuse us.

856
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,834
It's not Essenic.
It's not Chaldean.

857
00:56:43,225 --> 00:56:44,836
It ain't French.

858
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:49,318
This is pre-Sumerian.
This is pre-Sanskrit.

859
00:56:49,493 --> 00:56:51,103
Well, what does it mean?

860
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:53,497
Five people in the world
can understand these words.

861
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:57,501
Whi... which means
my colleague Dr. Jahangiri

862
00:56:57,675 --> 00:56:59,198
put you up to this.

863
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:03,115
Jahangiri's already dead.

864
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:05,378
- What?!
- No. Your colleague's...

865
00:57:05,552 --> 00:57:07,424
- Your colleague's fine.
Sorry.

866
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:09,991
What the fudge
is wrong with you?

867
00:57:10,165 --> 00:57:13,517
Listen, this language has been
dead for thousands of years.

868
00:57:13,691 --> 00:57:15,649
How did you get this recording?

869
00:57:16,694 --> 00:57:18,522
Do you believe
in spiritual inhabitation?

870
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:20,959
Spectral possession?

871
00:57:21,133 --> 00:57:23,570
Look, there's a reason
I'm down here in the basement.

872
00:57:23,744 --> 00:57:26,268
I'm the library folklorist.
I'm also the tristate treasurer

873
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:28,053
of the H.P. Lovecraft Society,
so...

874
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:30,403
Do I believe in spirits?
Yes, I believe in spirits.

875
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:32,274
I believe
in self-winding clocks

876
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,276
and the singing cheeses
of Copenhagen.

877
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:35,843
Please continue.

878
00:57:36,017 --> 00:57:38,542
All right.
The ancient chants you heard

879
00:57:38,716 --> 00:57:40,848
came from
this mysterious object.

880
00:57:41,022 --> 00:57:42,807
It's about the size
of a boccie ball.

881
00:57:45,766 --> 00:57:47,159
Come with me to the library.

882
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,596
- Are we not in the library?

883
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:51,642
Upstairs is just for show.

884
00:57:51,816 --> 00:57:53,557
Gilded research rooms
where struggling actors

885
00:57:53,731 --> 00:57:56,255
can Twitch-stream
and buy crypto.

886
00:57:56,429 --> 00:57:59,084
The old library is below.

887
00:58:04,872 --> 00:58:07,527
- Welcome to the old library.
-Whoa.

888
00:58:09,355 --> 00:58:11,705
That object of yours--

889
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:16,667
its last recorded sighting...

890
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:22,063
...wasn't photographed,
and it wasn't painted.

891
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:27,242
It was carved in stone.

892
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:29,288
Whoa.

893
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:32,900
Recognize anything?

894
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:35,076
There's your orb.

895
00:58:35,468 --> 00:58:37,035
What is it?

896
00:58:37,209 --> 00:58:39,820
Well, the better question is:
What's inside of it?

897
00:58:40,691 --> 00:58:41,822
What's inside of it?

898
00:58:41,996 --> 00:58:44,433
Excellent question.
Probably sand.

899
00:58:44,608 --> 00:58:46,610
But if you believe
the folklore--

900
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:49,134
and I always believe
the folklore--

901
00:58:49,308 --> 00:58:52,659
that orb is a magical prison

902
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:56,141
for a phantom god
called Garraka.

903
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:00,493
See, 4,000 years ago,

904
00:59:00,667 --> 00:59:03,278
Garraka served
a bloodthirsty king

905
00:59:03,452 --> 00:59:04,976
called Samudari.

906
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,021
You know, from the Battle
of the Seven Armies,

907
00:59:07,195 --> 00:59:09,023
et cetera, et cetera.

908
00:59:09,197 --> 00:59:11,983
After Garraka helped conquer
half of Central Asia,

909
00:59:12,157 --> 00:59:16,030
the king grew suspicious
of his ambitions.

910
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:20,034
Garraka was captured, branded,
broken and disfigured.

911
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:22,471
His horns, the source
of his greatest strength,

912
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:24,691
were, like, ripped
off his head.

913
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:26,258
Nasty stuff.

914
00:59:26,432 --> 00:59:27,825
I love it. No notes.

915
00:59:27,999 --> 00:59:29,827
But Garraka didn't take
too kindly to that

916
00:59:30,001 --> 00:59:33,526
and went on a bit
of a murder bender.

917
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:37,138
His plan was to raise an army
of the undead

918
00:59:37,312 --> 00:59:42,317
and wage war on humanity by
channeling fear into a weapon.

919
00:59:45,016 --> 00:59:46,365
Kusharit Umoti.

920
00:59:47,453 --> 00:59:49,194
The Death Chill.

921
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:52,371
The power to kill
by fear itself.

922
00:59:52,545 --> 00:59:54,895
A cold shiver runs
down your spine.

923
00:59:55,679 --> 00:59:57,942
Your veins turn
to rivers of ice.

924
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,248
Your bones crack.

925
01:00:00,422 --> 01:00:02,120
Your lungs cave.

926
01:00:02,294 --> 01:00:03,948
And the last thing you see

927
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:08,213
is your own tear ducts
freezing up.

928
01:00:11,303 --> 01:00:12,696
It's so cool.

929
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,915
Anyhoo, before Garraka
could collapse

930
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:19,267
the collective bronchial tubes
of greater South Asia,

931
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:21,705
he finally met his match.

932
01:00:21,879 --> 01:00:24,751
His icy spell was shattered
by a roving band

933
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:29,538
of mythical spirit catchers
called the Firemasters,

934
01:00:29,713 --> 01:00:31,018
who used fire and brass

935
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:35,153
to trap the evil god
inside of an orb.

936
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:38,852
The very orb you now possess.

937
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:43,204
Kind of like Ghostbusters.

938
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:45,163
Yeah.

939
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:50,081
If you're willing to entertain
a little historical gossip...

940
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:55,739
These are wax cylinders.

941
01:00:55,913 --> 01:00:57,610
19th-century audio recordings.

942
01:00:57,784 --> 01:01:00,352
Our collection is bonkers.
Here.

943
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:03,268
Mary Todd Lincoln
using the f-word.

944
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:05,096
Apparently, she saw a moth.

945
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:09,753
But the one I think you'll be
most interested in is...

946
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:11,885
this one.

947
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:15,628
See, back in the Gilded Age
of our fair metropolis,

948
01:01:15,802 --> 01:01:17,674
there was this group
of rich assholes called

949
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:21,155
the Manhattan
Adventurers Society.

950
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:23,114
They would steal relics
and artifacts.

951
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:24,637
They'd get together.

952
01:01:24,811 --> 01:01:26,378
They'd enjoy them
with their Beaujolais

953
01:01:26,552 --> 01:01:27,727
and a couple of hookers.

954
01:01:27,901 --> 01:01:30,687
Real colonial loot fest
kind of stuff.

955
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:32,776
Anyway, one night,
they took out

956
01:01:32,950 --> 01:01:37,476
a particularly rare relic,
the Orb of Garraka.

957
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:41,219
And then they played
this chant,

958
01:01:41,393 --> 01:01:44,222
which opened the orb.

959
01:01:46,267 --> 01:01:49,662
For the first time
in New York history,

960
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:53,753
a room full of people
froze to death

961
01:01:53,927 --> 01:01:56,147
in the middle of July.

962
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:16,733
Uh...

963
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:18,560
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

964
01:02:27,352 --> 01:02:28,745
It's the Possessor!

965
01:02:28,919 --> 01:02:30,485
- He's got the chant! Stop him!

966
01:02:35,577 --> 01:02:37,014
Stop that bag!

967
01:02:37,188 --> 01:02:38,842
-Excuse us!
- Wh-- Hey!

968
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:40,800
-Move, move, move!
- No running!

969
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:46,501
Go left!

970
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:48,199
Get it!
Keep your eyes on it!

971
01:02:50,027 --> 01:02:52,246
Shh.

972
01:03:12,527 --> 01:03:13,877
Excuse me.

973
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:31,808
What the hell was that?

974
01:03:31,982 --> 01:03:33,244
Oh, Possessor ghost.

975
01:03:33,418 --> 01:03:34,767
Master of concealment
and disguise.

976
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:36,508
Now it'll be
impossible to find.

977
01:03:36,682 --> 01:03:38,075
Oh, oh, there it is.

978
01:03:39,554 --> 01:03:40,991
Well, that's a close one.

979
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:44,124
You don't want that
getting away.

980
01:03:44,298 --> 01:03:45,734
- Give me a boost, will you?
- Oh, yeah. Okay.

981
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:47,345
I got you.

982
01:03:49,564 --> 01:03:51,044
Oh, my God.

983
01:04:05,798 --> 01:04:06,712
Dr. Ray!

984
01:04:06,886 --> 01:04:08,453
The bike! Push the button!

985
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,065
Uh...

986
01:04:13,632 --> 01:04:15,634
-Press the button!
- There's too many buttons!

987
01:04:21,118 --> 01:04:23,163
Oh!

988
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:28,777
Come on!

989
01:04:31,780 --> 01:04:32,956
Yes!

990
01:04:44,358 --> 01:04:46,404
- Podcast, do something!
- I-I'm trying!

991
01:04:46,578 --> 01:04:47,884
- Come on!

992
01:04:48,058 --> 01:04:50,451
- Hurry up! Push the button!
- I'm trying...

993
01:05:03,812 --> 01:05:05,684
Hands where we can see 'em!

994
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:08,121
- Step forward.

995
01:05:08,295 --> 01:05:09,993
The lions, Phoebe.

996
01:05:10,167 --> 01:05:12,691
They're iconic.
People love them.

997
01:05:12,865 --> 01:05:15,650
They make kids want
to visit the library.

998
01:05:15,824 --> 01:05:17,696
Do you know how hard it is

999
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,698
to get kids to visit
the library?

1000
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:21,352
I love the library.

1001
01:05:21,526 --> 01:05:23,571
Then why did you shoot
Fortitude in the face?

1002
01:05:23,745 --> 01:05:24,659
I was doing my job.

1003
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,139
You don't have a job!

1004
01:05:26,313 --> 01:05:28,185
-Magnifique!

1005
01:05:28,359 --> 01:05:30,448
My compliments to the chef.

1006
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:34,713
As far as fiascos go,
this was just dynamite.

1007
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:36,410
One would think, though,

1008
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:39,500
you'd have a little more respect
for the public library,

1009
01:05:39,674 --> 01:05:41,372
you being such a bookworm.

1010
01:05:41,546 --> 01:05:43,678
- Why don't you just back off.
- I just want to thank her.

1011
01:05:44,592 --> 01:05:46,159
For what?

1012
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,553
For 40 years, I've been waiting
to say these words.

1013
01:05:49,728 --> 01:05:52,861
The Ghostbusters are finished.

1014
01:05:53,036 --> 01:05:54,863
Your firehouse
has been condemned.

1015
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:56,430
Your packs are
in a police lockup.

1016
01:05:56,604 --> 01:05:58,258
They'll be melted down
for scrap by morning.

1017
01:05:58,432 --> 01:06:00,565
And just wait until
I get ahold of your car.

1018
01:06:00,739 --> 01:06:02,001
Now, just hold on here...

1019
01:06:02,175 --> 01:06:03,437
The last time you tried
to shut us down,

1020
01:06:03,611 --> 01:06:05,744
you created a crossrip
into another dimension.

1021
01:06:05,918 --> 01:06:06,919
Watch out, kiddo.

1022
01:06:07,093 --> 01:06:08,921
That sounds a lot like slander.

1023
01:06:09,095 --> 01:06:11,924
That's a crime punishable
with time in prison.

1024
01:06:12,098 --> 01:06:14,057
So let me ask you,
Miss Spengler,

1025
01:06:14,231 --> 01:06:16,059
are you going to behave,

1026
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:19,062
or do I need
to have you arrested?

1027
01:06:32,553 --> 01:06:36,296
Well, we really thought
you were gonna choose "behave."

1028
01:06:37,471 --> 01:06:38,690
Sure, I get it. You're upset.

1029
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:40,039
Can we just get to the part

1030
01:06:40,213 --> 01:06:41,388
where you ground me
and move on?

1031
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:43,303
Oh, you're not grounded.
You're fired.

1032
01:06:46,132 --> 01:06:47,264
Honestly,
if you weren't a Spengler,

1033
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:49,005
you'd be answering our phones.

1034
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:51,703
- Excuse me?
- Don't talk to her like that.

1035
01:06:52,573 --> 01:06:53,531
Are you serious?

1036
01:06:53,705 --> 01:06:55,054
I'm very serious.

1037
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:56,969
She's your mom.

1038
01:06:57,143 --> 01:06:58,710
Being a Spengler
doesn't make you a genius.

1039
01:06:58,884 --> 01:07:00,146
It just makes you
part of this family.

1040
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,669
Are you even a part
of this family?

1041
01:07:01,843 --> 01:07:03,410
- Phoebe.
- It's...

1042
01:07:04,368 --> 01:07:07,197
Yeah. I get it. Fair enough.

1043
01:07:07,371 --> 01:07:08,981
But maybe if you weren't
being so selfish,

1044
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:10,548
you might notice that your mom,

1045
01:07:10,722 --> 01:07:12,289
your brother and I
have been doing everything

1046
01:07:12,463 --> 01:07:15,248
to try and protect you,
so wake up!

1047
01:07:22,516 --> 01:07:24,344
Sucks, doesn't it?

1048
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:25,911
WINSTON [VOICE-OVER]: What the
hell were you thinking?

1049
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:27,521
You don't get it.
There was a wax cylinder.

1050
01:07:27,695 --> 01:07:29,045
- There was chanting.
- You do realize what kind

1051
01:07:29,219 --> 01:07:30,611
of trouble you've gotten
yourself into today?

1052
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:31,395
The gramophone handle
was turning by its...

1053
01:07:31,569 --> 01:07:32,178
Ray, shut up!

1054
01:07:32,352 --> 01:07:34,267
Shut up. Ray.

1055
01:07:35,442 --> 01:07:36,400
Geez.

1056
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:38,532
We're too old for this.

1057
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,535
Zedd, I...

1058
01:07:41,709 --> 01:07:43,798
I don't know what our age
has to do with this.

1059
01:07:43,972 --> 01:07:45,539
There was, uh, chanting
coming out of that cylinder.

1060
01:07:45,713 --> 01:07:47,454
- Ray.
- It's a trigger.

1061
01:07:47,628 --> 01:07:50,066
- It's a catalyst. It's a key.
- You could've got yourself hurt.

1062
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:53,156
You could've got
those kids hurt.

1063
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:56,115
Geez, Ray.

1064
01:07:56,855 --> 01:07:58,074
Take a vacation, okay?

1065
01:07:58,248 --> 01:07:59,727
Go visit some old ruins
or something.

1066
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:01,338
I don't know, sit your ass
on a beach somewhere.

1067
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:03,340
A little color
wouldn't kill you.

1068
01:08:04,384 --> 01:08:08,519
Ray, this is supposed to be
our golden years.

1069
01:08:09,433 --> 01:08:11,174
Winston...

1070
01:08:11,348 --> 01:08:14,612
this is the way I want
to spend my golden years.

1071
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:17,571
This is what I love.

1072
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:20,313
I know. I know.

1073
01:08:20,835 --> 01:08:22,576
Me, too.

1074
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,710
But you need to find a new way
to do the things you love

1075
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:27,364
before it kills you.

1076
01:08:42,727 --> 01:08:43,728
Pheebs.

1077
01:08:52,215 --> 01:08:53,781
Oh, man.

1078
01:08:56,828 --> 01:08:58,395
They stole our gear.

1079
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:02,007
"Civil forfeiture," I believe,
is the terminology.

1080
01:09:02,181 --> 01:09:04,879
- Stop it! Fire pole?
-Oh, yeah.

1081
01:09:05,053 --> 01:09:05,924
You really got to try
that thing, dude.

1082
01:09:06,098 --> 01:09:07,404
Who is he?

1083
01:09:07,578 --> 01:09:09,145
Oh, I'm Nadeem.
I'm a potential deep well

1084
01:09:09,319 --> 01:09:12,148
of psychokinetic energy
and quite possibly possessed.

1085
01:09:12,322 --> 01:09:13,758
Can I try the fire pole?

1086
01:09:14,976 --> 01:09:16,761
Yeah. Knock your socks off.

1087
01:09:18,241 --> 01:09:20,765
Is this the last night
in the firehouse?

1088
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:23,376
I don't know.

1089
01:09:28,903 --> 01:09:29,948
Hey.

1090
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:32,951
So this is it, huh?

1091
01:09:34,648 --> 01:09:37,216
I'm used to being on the move.
I'm good at it.

1092
01:09:39,871 --> 01:09:40,828
I don't know.

1093
01:09:41,873 --> 01:09:45,050
I'd kind of like to stay
and fight for this place.

1094
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:46,399
It's not our place.

1095
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:48,184
Of course it is.

1096
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:50,664
We can't leave.

1097
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:52,884
I mean...

1098
01:09:54,842 --> 01:09:57,932
If there's something strange
in the neighborhood...

1099
01:09:59,891 --> 01:10:01,806
...who are they gonna call?

1100
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:05,810
If there's something weird
and it don't look good...

1101
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:10,206
- ...who-who you gonna call?
- Ghostbusters.

1102
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,164
What? I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, what was that?

1103
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:14,514
- Ghostbusters.
- Ghostbusters.

1104
01:10:15,559 --> 01:10:17,648
This is the home
of the Ghostbusters.

1105
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,780
We're the Ghostbusters.

1106
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,219
Can I tell you something else?

1107
01:10:23,828 --> 01:10:24,785
It's important.

1108
01:10:25,525 --> 01:10:26,439
What?

1109
01:10:27,658 --> 01:10:29,007
- Busting makes me feel good.
- No.

1110
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:30,965
- No. Get out.
- It makes...

1111
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,494
Holy crap!
This place is trashed.

1112
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:39,496
I'm trying to get
a reading in here, please.

1113
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,193
- What happened here?
- Okay, look...

1114
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:43,064
Such a disaster.
What have you done?

1115
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,805
This is a very sensitive area.

1116
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:46,372
Oh, it is freezing.

1117
01:10:46,546 --> 01:10:48,069
Yeah, well,
maybe it wouldn't be freezing

1118
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,767
if a certain someone
had left his grandmother's orb

1119
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:51,247
in her room where it belongs.

1120
01:10:51,943 --> 01:10:53,553
Wait, I'm confused.

1121
01:10:53,727 --> 01:10:56,034
You're saying this is my fault?

1122
01:10:56,208 --> 01:10:57,644
Here's the deal.

1123
01:10:57,818 --> 01:10:59,951
Your grandmother was
guardian of the orb,

1124
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,867
the last line of defense
against Garraka.

1125
01:11:03,041 --> 01:11:04,347
Now it's your turn.

1126
01:11:04,521 --> 01:11:06,218
You are the Firemaster.

1127
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:08,264
Ooh, that's dramatic.
I like that.

1128
01:11:08,438 --> 01:11:10,048
It's not a joke, man.

1129
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:11,441
For thousands of years,
your family

1130
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,138
has selflessly guarded
the world

1131
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:15,053
from an unimaginable evil.

1132
01:11:15,227 --> 01:11:16,750
Now, either she didn't
tell you about it

1133
01:11:16,924 --> 01:11:19,013
- or you weren't listening.
- Could've been either.

1134
01:11:19,187 --> 01:11:20,928
We had
a complicated relationship.

1135
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:22,800
Instead, you come into my shop,

1136
01:11:22,974 --> 01:11:25,324
try to sell your heritage--
your birthright-- for 50 bucks.

1137
01:11:25,498 --> 01:11:27,152
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

1138
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:28,414
Who are you? Who's that?

1139
01:11:28,588 --> 01:11:30,503
You are the Firemaster.

1140
01:11:31,635 --> 01:11:33,811
It's time for you
to claim your destiny, son.

1141
01:11:43,211 --> 01:11:44,430
Light the candle.

1142
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:47,041
I think we both know
that's impossible.

1143
01:11:47,215 --> 01:11:50,523
Son, I stopped believing
in that word a long time ago.

1144
01:11:50,697 --> 01:11:52,830
What if you were
humanity's last hope?

1145
01:11:53,004 --> 01:11:54,875
Dude, I've never been
anyone's only hope.

1146
01:11:55,049 --> 01:11:57,530
I went to senior prom as
a backup for someone's brother.

1147
01:11:57,704 --> 01:11:59,271
You may not choose
to believe it,

1148
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:01,055
but there are many stories
of people

1149
01:12:01,229 --> 01:12:04,232
with inexplicable gifts,
going back eons.

1150
01:12:04,407 --> 01:12:07,235
The strength of Samson,
the speed of Achilles.

1151
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:09,977
Perfect pitch, sick dance moves.

1152
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:11,501
Even pyrokinesis.

1153
01:12:12,066 --> 01:12:13,067
So...

1154
01:12:14,155 --> 01:12:15,418
light the candle.

1155
01:12:17,245 --> 01:12:18,551
Light the candle?

1156
01:12:19,247 --> 01:12:20,597
Just like that?

1157
01:12:20,771 --> 01:12:22,425
I just do that...

1158
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,039
What?

1159
01:12:38,832 --> 01:12:40,312
Oh.

1160
01:12:40,486 --> 01:12:43,228
Indus literature speaks
of a sacred fire,

1161
01:12:43,402 --> 01:12:44,534
a smokeless flame,

1162
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:46,623
like the kind Moses saw
on Mount Horeb

1163
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:48,712
when he encountered
the burning bush.

1164
01:12:48,886 --> 01:12:50,931
Like the kind the demon djinn
brought forth

1165
01:12:51,105 --> 01:12:52,455
from the seven earths,

1166
01:12:52,629 --> 01:12:54,370
that flowed through the hair
of Sambo-Kojin,

1167
01:12:54,544 --> 01:12:56,459
the Japanese god of the hearth.

1168
01:12:56,633 --> 01:13:00,376
That same sacred power exists
in your fingertips.

1169
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:02,900
Wow.

1170
01:13:04,075 --> 01:13:05,119
Oh.

1171
01:13:06,904 --> 01:13:08,384
Light the candle.

1172
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:12,388
It's his first time.

1173
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,651
I think we're all going to die.

1174
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:22,180
Phoebe?

1175
01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:25,488
Um, can I come in?

1176
01:13:30,449 --> 01:13:31,798
I just wanted to talk to you

1177
01:13:31,972 --> 01:13:33,583
about what happened
at the police station.

1178
01:13:34,627 --> 01:13:37,456
Uh, because I-I know
that was rough.

1179
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,198
And, um...

1180
01:13:40,372 --> 01:13:41,634
but, you know, you know,
life is rough.

1181
01:13:41,808 --> 01:13:44,637
L-Life is unpredictable
and crazy and...

1182
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:50,513
Doors close. Friends change.

1183
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:55,648
But, uh... but family is...

1184
01:13:57,041 --> 01:13:59,173
...is the one thing
that's there no matter what.

1185
01:14:00,392 --> 01:14:03,526
You know, uh...

1186
01:14:03,700 --> 01:14:05,876
Sometimes they're not even
your actual blood relatives.

1187
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:07,051
They're just...

1188
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:09,967
They're the people
that remind you

1189
01:14:10,141 --> 01:14:11,229
you have a home.

1190
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:18,541
Anyway, I think you're great.

1191
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:22,675
I think you're really great.

1192
01:14:25,722 --> 01:14:27,245
I'm really glad
we had this talk.

1193
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,075
I don't know, every time I do
what I think is right,

1194
01:14:31,249 --> 01:14:34,470
they just come down on me like
I'm screwing everything up.

1195
01:14:34,644 --> 01:14:36,254
- That's ridiculous.
- I know.

1196
01:14:39,953 --> 01:14:41,564
What?

1197
01:14:41,738 --> 01:14:44,175
Just sucks that the only person
who gets me is...

1198
01:14:45,263 --> 01:14:47,091
a ghost.

1199
01:14:47,265 --> 01:14:50,616
Yeah. It's too bad we exist on
different dimensional planes.

1200
01:14:50,790 --> 01:14:53,227
Separated by quantum physics.

1201
01:14:53,401 --> 01:14:54,881
It's always something.

1202
01:14:58,755 --> 01:15:03,107
I mean, there is a way for me
to be a ghost for a bit.

1203
01:15:03,281 --> 01:15:05,675
But it's-it's experimental.

1204
01:15:05,849 --> 01:15:07,633
And you wouldn't want
to risk it.

1205
01:15:09,156 --> 01:15:10,767
It's not lethal.

1206
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,204
That's a plus.

1207
01:15:13,378 --> 01:15:14,597
Just requires a little bit
of light breaking and entering

1208
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:16,468
and some advanced science.

1209
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:19,253
I mean, I wouldn't want to
get you into any more trouble.

1210
01:15:20,777 --> 01:15:22,561
What else can they do to me?

1211
01:15:47,151 --> 01:15:48,152
What is that thing?

1212
01:15:48,848 --> 01:15:50,328
It's an ionic separator.

1213
01:15:50,502 --> 01:15:51,808
It'll allow us
to temporarily exist

1214
01:15:51,982 --> 01:15:54,114
- on the same dimensional plane.

1215
01:15:55,507 --> 01:15:57,030
My spirit will be separated
from my body

1216
01:15:57,204 --> 01:15:58,336
for only two minutes.

1217
01:16:00,294 --> 01:16:01,948
Then I'll regain consciousness.

1218
01:17:24,944 --> 01:17:25,945
Boo.

1219
01:17:31,385 --> 01:17:32,343
What's wrong?

1220
01:17:34,737 --> 01:17:35,999
I'm sorry.

1221
01:17:38,349 --> 01:17:39,350
For what?

1222
01:17:43,746 --> 01:17:45,661
A human voice is the key.

1223
01:17:51,144 --> 01:17:52,972
But Garraka
can't control humans.

1224
01:17:53,146 --> 01:17:55,192
- Only ghosts.

1225
01:17:56,497 --> 01:17:58,586
And now he can control you.

1226
01:18:11,599 --> 01:18:14,472
Garraka's the only one that can
open the door to the other side.

1227
01:18:18,215 --> 01:18:19,390
It's my only chance.

1228
01:18:25,962 --> 01:18:28,660
My only chance
to see my family again.

1229
01:18:33,926 --> 01:18:35,493
Maybe one day,
you'll understand.

1230
01:19:15,315 --> 01:19:19,493
Your world will shatter.

1231
01:19:20,538 --> 01:19:23,628
Bones and ice.

1232
01:19:25,848 --> 01:19:30,548
My empire will rise.

1233
01:19:41,037 --> 01:19:42,473
Hey, asshole.

1234
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,227
Lucky!

1235
01:20:23,775 --> 01:20:25,385
-Phoebe?
-Over here.

1236
01:20:25,559 --> 01:20:26,822
Phoebe. Are you okay?

1237
01:20:26,996 --> 01:20:28,475
- She ghost-walked.
- What?

1238
01:20:28,649 --> 01:20:30,216
Her spirit separated
from her body.

1239
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:31,696
- Oh, my God, you're freezing.
- I tried to stop it.

1240
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,002
- I couldn't.
-No, it's okay.

1241
01:20:33,176 --> 01:20:34,873
No, you're okay.
That's all that matters.

1242
01:20:35,047 --> 01:20:36,353
- We're in trouble. We're...
- No, you're not in trouble.

1243
01:20:36,527 --> 01:20:37,615
- You're not in trouble.
-She's right.

1244
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:41,880
We're all in big trouble.

1245
01:20:52,195 --> 01:20:53,587
Yeah,
just give me a minute.

1246
01:20:53,761 --> 01:20:55,633
Just, uh, finishing this up.

1247
01:20:55,807 --> 01:20:57,461
I'll be right with you.

1248
01:20:57,635 --> 01:21:01,117
Are you the Firemaster?

1249
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:03,641
Yeah, man, read the damn sign.

1250
01:22:40,216 --> 01:22:42,958
- I love that.
- What is that?

1251
01:23:25,870 --> 01:23:27,176
Should we call this one in?

1252
01:23:27,350 --> 01:23:29,047
Yeah, call this one in.

1253
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:30,962
-Taxi!

1254
01:23:44,410 --> 01:23:46,891
It's okay if you guys hate me.

1255
01:23:47,065 --> 01:23:48,719
We don't hate you.
We were worried about you.

1256
01:23:48,893 --> 01:23:52,331
We didn't know where you were.
You could've been killed.

1257
01:23:52,505 --> 01:23:54,725
I trusted somebody
that I shouldn't have.

1258
01:23:54,899 --> 01:23:57,032
I just feel stupid.

1259
01:23:57,206 --> 01:23:58,685
It's okay to feel stupid.

1260
01:23:58,859 --> 01:24:00,470
Some of the smartest people
I know are morons.

1261
01:24:00,644 --> 01:24:02,907
Yeah, and I told you
to make mistakes.

1262
01:24:03,081 --> 01:24:04,952
Yeah, not release
a monstrous deity.

1263
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:06,432
Maybe next time, get a tattoo.

1264
01:24:06,606 --> 01:24:08,956
Or try shoplifting.
Hey, that'd be fun.

1265
01:24:09,131 --> 01:24:10,523
Yeah. Okay.

1266
01:24:11,959 --> 01:24:13,222
Hey.

1267
01:24:13,396 --> 01:24:15,224
Are you ready
to be a Spengler again?

1268
01:24:16,834 --> 01:24:18,575
Good, 'cause we need you.

1269
01:24:18,749 --> 01:24:19,750
Yeah.

1270
01:24:32,110 --> 01:24:33,633
-Phoebe.

1271
01:24:33,807 --> 01:24:35,592
-How did Garraka get out?
-Doesn't matter.

1272
01:24:35,766 --> 01:24:37,855
It's coming right for us,
and it's really bad out there.

1273
01:24:38,029 --> 01:24:39,204
Wh-Who's coming right for us?

1274
01:24:39,378 --> 01:24:41,337
Typical manifestation of evil.

1275
01:24:41,511 --> 01:24:43,426
Ender of worlds,
that kind of thing.

1276
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,384
Garraka's coming
for the containment unit

1277
01:24:45,558 --> 01:24:47,995
to recruit every ghost
in the tank we've ever caught.

1278
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:49,867
We can't allow that to happen.

1279
01:24:50,041 --> 01:24:51,782
He'll have a veritable
army of ghosts.

1280
01:24:51,956 --> 01:24:54,176
Army of ghosts?
- Guys, it's okay. We're fine.

1281
01:24:54,350 --> 01:24:56,178
Look, we're good. Calm down.

1282
01:24:56,352 --> 01:24:58,615
We have the Firemaster.

1283
01:25:00,182 --> 01:25:01,618
Do the thing.

1284
01:25:01,792 --> 01:25:03,098
This is really great.
You're gonna love it.

1285
01:25:04,229 --> 01:25:07,189
Okay,
just like we practiced.

1286
01:25:15,632 --> 01:25:16,676
Huh?

1287
01:25:16,850 --> 01:25:18,374
- Huh?
- Yes!

1288
01:25:21,377 --> 01:25:22,508
- Great.
-Huh?

1289
01:25:22,682 --> 01:25:24,162
Great.

1290
01:25:27,948 --> 01:25:29,385
Where are our proton packs?

1291
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:34,781
New packs.

1292
01:25:42,441 --> 01:25:43,442
Suit up.

1293
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:45,488
Get to the roof, all right?

1294
01:25:45,662 --> 01:25:48,360
Just shoot anything
that looks terrifying.

1295
01:25:48,534 --> 01:25:50,232
But I already threw
a proton stream at that thing.

1296
01:25:50,406 --> 01:25:52,451
- It didn't even flinch.
- How is that possible?

1297
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:54,410
It's an ancient god
from another dimension.

1298
01:25:54,584 --> 01:25:56,629
Who's to know
its atomic composition?

1299
01:25:58,849 --> 01:26:00,155
- Dr. Ray?
- Yeah?

1300
01:26:00,329 --> 01:26:01,765
Copper can conduct
an electrical field

1301
01:26:01,939 --> 01:26:03,593
like the one in our colliders.

1302
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:05,856
Yeah, but there's no copper
left in the firehouse.

1303
01:26:06,030 --> 01:26:08,467
Stripped by vagrants
in the '90s.

1304
01:26:09,425 --> 01:26:11,427
Well, then what about brass?

1305
01:26:12,602 --> 01:26:14,430
Brass.

1306
01:26:14,604 --> 01:26:16,867
Especially if it's
psychically charged.

1307
01:26:25,702 --> 01:26:27,356
PHOEBE [VOICE-OVER]: Our proton
packs use nickel and zinc

1308
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:29,967
as primary drivers
for spectral agitation.

1309
01:26:31,447 --> 01:26:33,275
But Garraka is different.

1310
01:26:34,624 --> 01:26:37,627
The ancient ghost trappers
used brass to trap him.

1311
01:26:42,284 --> 01:26:44,373
If I brass-plate
the components of my pack,

1312
01:26:44,547 --> 01:26:47,289
it could give us a chance.

1313
01:27:01,955 --> 01:27:02,826
Switch me on.

1314
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:15,360
Wow, he managed
a faster decay of split time

1315
01:27:15,534 --> 01:27:17,884
and narrowed
the stream intensification.

1316
01:27:18,058 --> 01:27:19,408
Terrific new improvements.

1317
01:27:22,062 --> 01:27:22,976
Let's get to work.

1318
01:27:56,314 --> 01:27:57,533
Here we go.

1319
01:28:10,067 --> 01:28:12,199
- Can I be of any help?
-Son of a bitch.

1320
01:28:12,374 --> 01:28:14,724
- Venkman.
- You got to be kidding me.

1321
01:28:14,898 --> 01:28:16,378
Home sweet home.

1322
01:28:17,901 --> 01:28:20,077
Melnitz in uniform.

1323
01:28:20,251 --> 01:28:21,948
Looking sporty.

1324
01:28:23,863 --> 01:28:25,865
Oh.

1325
01:28:27,302 --> 01:28:28,868
Courage, anyone?

1326
01:28:42,273 --> 01:28:43,143
-No, no, no, no, no,

1327
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:44,754
I don't like that.

1328
01:28:44,928 --> 01:28:46,277
- What do you see up there?
-A trike.

1329
01:28:46,451 --> 01:28:47,800
- Tell them it's a trike.
- A what?

1330
01:28:47,974 --> 01:28:50,455
A kid's tricycle
rolling down the street

1331
01:28:50,629 --> 01:28:51,935
- on its own.
- No, no. Possessor.

1332
01:28:52,109 --> 01:28:54,111
- Possessor.
- You need to get down here now.

1333
01:28:54,285 --> 01:28:55,199
Yeah.

1334
01:29:05,427 --> 01:29:06,297
- What's going on?

1335
01:29:06,471 --> 01:29:07,820
Oh, it's really bad.

1336
01:29:07,994 --> 01:29:09,213
The world's ending.
Do not go up there.

1337
01:29:09,387 --> 01:29:10,693
- How's it going?
- Oh, terrible.

1338
01:29:10,867 --> 01:29:12,782
Okay,
just keep practicing, man.

1339
01:29:12,956 --> 01:29:14,740
We got your back.

1340
01:29:14,914 --> 01:29:17,134
Could one of the adults
also come and help?

1341
01:29:32,149 --> 01:29:33,803
-Whoa!

1342
01:29:52,909 --> 01:29:53,823
It's possessed!

1343
01:29:53,997 --> 01:29:55,172
- Run!

1344
01:29:57,740 --> 01:29:59,829
-Whoa!

1345
01:30:35,952 --> 01:30:38,955
- Oh, my God.

1346
01:30:44,482 --> 01:30:46,310
Oh.

1347
01:30:46,484 --> 01:30:47,920
Gave me the fright of my life.

1348
01:30:48,094 --> 01:30:49,661
I thought you were
one of the big, scary ones.

1349
01:30:56,581 --> 01:30:57,974
How'd you get
all the way up here?

1350
01:31:02,544 --> 01:31:04,937
Ooh, paper.

1351
01:31:06,025 --> 01:31:07,026
That's random.

1352
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,115
Lucky!

1353
01:31:09,289 --> 01:31:11,553
- Lucky, are you okay?

1354
01:31:14,381 --> 01:31:15,905
Oh, shit.

1355
01:31:18,864 --> 01:31:19,865
Trevor!

1356
01:31:40,233 --> 01:31:41,757
You're doing it!

1357
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:43,062
This is awesome!

1358
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:02,168
I know that guy!

1359
01:32:05,389 --> 01:32:06,782
I am a god.

1360
01:32:07,565 --> 01:32:08,479
Where's Phoebe?

1361
01:32:20,970 --> 01:32:22,058
Good luck.

1362
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:43,035
So, was any of it real?

1363
01:32:44,559 --> 01:32:47,257
Yeah. I actually did
beat you at chess.

1364
01:32:56,353 --> 01:32:57,572
I never wanted to hurt you.

1365
01:32:57,746 --> 01:33:00,139
I just wanted
to see my family again.

1366
01:33:00,313 --> 01:33:01,750
Well, my family's up there now.

1367
01:33:02,968 --> 01:33:04,840
We still have time
to stop this.

1368
01:33:06,015 --> 01:33:07,016
It's too late.

1369
01:33:10,672 --> 01:33:11,847
He's here.

1370
01:33:30,474 --> 01:33:32,781
Phoebe? Phoebe!

1371
01:33:43,052 --> 01:33:44,270
Heads up.

1372
01:33:44,444 --> 01:33:46,272
Tall, dark and horny
at 12 o'clock.

1373
01:33:52,322 --> 01:33:53,715
Ah!

1374
01:34:13,691 --> 01:34:15,519
Garraka can't help you move on.

1375
01:34:15,693 --> 01:34:17,173
You have to do that yourself.

1376
01:34:26,573 --> 01:34:28,271
Don't let him get
to the basement!

1377
01:34:28,445 --> 01:34:29,446
How?

1378
01:34:30,621 --> 01:34:32,188
Well, being nice didn't work.

1379
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:38,194
- Let's try this.
- Light 'em up!

1380
01:34:42,459 --> 01:34:45,810
I tried to tell you guys
our throwers are useless.

1381
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:00,477
Hold on, hold on,
hold on.

1382
01:35:04,611 --> 01:35:05,874
Okay.

1383
01:35:07,789 --> 01:35:09,312
Look, dude, I'm...

1384
01:35:09,486 --> 01:35:11,444
I'm probably
your worst nightmare.

1385
01:35:12,968 --> 01:35:14,056
Okay. Okay, okay.

1386
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:18,538
Real talk, man to... whatever.

1387
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,018
I don't want to hurt you.

1388
01:35:20,192 --> 01:35:21,585
Okay? So, how about
we call this even,

1389
01:35:21,759 --> 01:35:23,108
we each go our separate ways.

1390
01:35:23,282 --> 01:35:26,111
I go back to Queens,
you go back to Narnia.

1391
01:35:36,687 --> 01:35:41,300
You are no Firemaster.

1392
01:35:42,954 --> 01:35:46,262
Me? No, I'm not the Firemaster.

1393
01:35:46,436 --> 01:35:48,786
I'm just Nadeem.

1394
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:51,963
And let the record show
I gave you a chance.

1395
01:35:57,882 --> 01:35:59,710
Dude, did you use
all the lighter fluid?

1396
01:35:59,884 --> 01:36:01,407
You told me to practice.

1397
01:36:03,105 --> 01:36:05,455
Um, does anyone have a light?

1398
01:36:05,629 --> 01:36:07,544
I-I quit smoking in the '90s.

1399
01:36:07,718 --> 01:36:09,546
Proud of you then,
proud of you now.

1400
01:36:11,156 --> 01:36:13,202
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

1401
01:36:14,507 --> 01:36:15,552
Uh...

1402
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:25,301
- Get out of the way!

1403
01:36:25,475 --> 01:36:27,520
- Move!

1404
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,045
Look out!

1405
01:36:53,329 --> 01:36:54,330
Bye, Phoebe.

1406
01:39:55,772 --> 01:39:57,469
-Phoebe!

1407
01:40:13,355 --> 01:40:15,226
They're pinning him!
We can trap him now!

1408
01:40:43,602 --> 01:40:45,300
No!

1409
01:40:45,474 --> 01:40:47,171
We're gonna need a bigger trap.

1410
01:40:47,911 --> 01:40:49,173
It's right there.

1411
01:40:49,347 --> 01:40:50,435
Garraka's let
all the spirits out.

1412
01:40:50,609 --> 01:40:51,697
Peter, do you know
what this means?

1413
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:53,482
You know what we could do?

1414
01:40:53,656 --> 01:40:54,744
Ray, pretend I don't.

1415
01:40:59,575 --> 01:41:02,186
If we neutralize
the mass-energy d-density

1416
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:04,971
to reduce criticality,
it will force the tank

1417
01:41:05,146 --> 01:41:06,190
to re-prime itself
and re-reverse the polar...

1418
01:41:06,364 --> 01:41:08,801
Just do it! We all trust you.

1419
01:41:17,288 --> 01:41:18,855
I can't hold him much longer!

1420
01:41:19,029 --> 01:41:21,249
-Come on!
- Hey, little help.

1421
01:41:37,700 --> 01:41:39,005
Golden years?

1422
01:41:39,180 --> 01:41:40,659
Golden years!

1423
01:42:12,517 --> 01:42:14,563
When the light is green...

1424
01:42:14,737 --> 01:42:16,304
The whole world is clean.

1425
01:42:18,262 --> 01:42:20,917
I knew you had
one more dance in you.

1426
01:42:24,616 --> 01:42:27,184
Yes!

1427
01:42:27,358 --> 01:42:28,925
You're toast.

1428
01:42:50,033 --> 01:42:51,252
You were right.

1429
01:42:53,776 --> 01:42:56,431
I'll see you in the fabric
of the universe.

1430
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:31,814
Mom.

1431
01:43:50,224 --> 01:43:52,182
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1432
01:43:52,356 --> 01:43:54,010
- Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1433
01:43:54,184 --> 01:43:57,361
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1434
01:43:57,535 --> 01:43:59,189

1435
01:43:59,363 --> 01:44:02,497
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!
Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1436

Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1437
01:44:04,542 --> 01:44:05,978
- Ghostbusters! Ghostbusters!

1438
01:44:14,030 --> 01:44:15,423
You have done it!

1439
01:44:16,337 --> 01:44:18,208
Citywide devastation.

1440
01:44:18,382 --> 01:44:20,602
I am putting you away
for a long ti...

1441
01:44:20,776 --> 01:44:22,256
Peck.

1442
01:44:22,430 --> 01:44:24,170
You clown.

1443
01:44:24,345 --> 01:44:25,302
You're never gonna
get it, are you?

1444
01:44:25,476 --> 01:44:26,825
Mr. Mayor!

1445
01:44:26,999 --> 01:44:28,479
What do you have to say
to the Ghostbusters?

1446
01:44:28,653 --> 01:44:30,264
Hey, how about
you thank them, dickless!

1447
01:44:30,438 --> 01:44:32,222
Wh-What... Uh, yes.

1448
01:44:32,396 --> 01:44:34,398
It sounds like we have
your undivided support.

1449
01:44:34,572 --> 01:44:35,965
Love you, Ghostbusters!

1450
01:44:36,139 --> 01:44:38,228
Uh, w-well, y-yes, of course.

1451
01:44:38,402 --> 01:44:40,056
Good. I'm so happy
to hear that, Mr. Mayor,

1452
01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:43,146
because without Phoebe
and her family, this whole city

1453
01:44:43,320 --> 01:44:44,930
would be under
three feet of ice.

1454
01:44:45,104 --> 01:44:46,497
- Yeah.

1455
01:44:46,671 --> 01:44:51,720
We know that
the world right now

1456
01:44:51,894 --> 01:44:55,985
is experiencing
unusual paranormal activity.

1457
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:58,379
We are here to answer that call

1458
01:44:58,553 --> 01:45:01,469
because we are
the Ghostbusters!

1459
01:45:06,778 --> 01:45:09,694

my first evil god.
